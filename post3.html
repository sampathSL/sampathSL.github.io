				<p>I have recently involved with integrating two different project components which are using jQuery and
				Prototype JavaScript libraries. One of major issue was projects are almost completed and having huge
				JavaScript code base. Initially integration was quite difficult because project was depending on
				specific JavaScript library versions. Requirement was to integrate code together without harming
				the existing code. Fortunately, jQuery code parts were very easy to modify, having known these
				kind of situations.</p>

				<p>jQuery.noConflict() has one simple purpose.It enables you to load multiple instances of jQuery on the same
				page typically different versions of jQuery at that. You may be wondering why you would ever want to do that.
				There are two primary reasons. First, you may want to use a jQuery plugin that is not compatible with the newest
				version of jQuery, while writing most of your jQuery code on the newest version of jQuery. Second, you may have
				no control over what jQuery version is loaded on a page,and you need to be sure a specific version of jQuery is
				loaded for your jQuery code or jQuery plugin to work.</p>

				<p>One of major issue was conflicting $ with jQuery and Prototype.
				While researching over the internet solution was became quite easy.</p>

				<p>In conclusion,  jQuery.noConflict() is an extremely powerful tool, and can be used to do great things for the Web.
				I hope you have found this article useful and informative.</p>
